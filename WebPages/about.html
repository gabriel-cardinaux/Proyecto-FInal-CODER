    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="div_about">
    <p>David Robert Jones was born in Brixton on January 8, 1947. At age 13, inspired by the jazz of the London West End, he picked up the saxophone and called up Ronnie Ross for lessons.
        Early bands he played with: The Kon-Rads, The King Bees, the Mannish Boys and the Lower Third provided him with an introduction into the showy worlds of pop and mod, and by 1966 he was David Bowie, with long hair and aspirations of stardom rustling about his head.
        Kenneth Pitt signed on as his manager, and his career began with a handful of mostly forgotten singles and a head full of ideas.
        It was not until 1969 that the splash onto the charts would begin, with the legendary Space Oddity (which peaked at  #5 in the UK).
        Amidst his musical wanderings in the late '60s, the young Bowie experimented with mixed media, cinema, mime, Tibetan Buddhism, acting and love.
        A first rock album, originally titled David Bowie then subsequently re-titled Man of Words, Man of Music and again as Space Oddity, paid homage to the kaleidoscopic influences of the London artistic scene, while hinting at a songwriting talent that was about to yield some of rock n roll's finest and most distinctive work--even if it would take the rest of the world a few years to catch up.</p>

    <h2>Early 70s</h2>
    <p>The Man Who Sold The World was the first David Bowie album recorded as an entity unto itself and marks ground zero of the first definitive creative stretch to come.
      Mick Ronson's guitars are often referred to as the birth point of heavy metal, and certainly the auspicious beginnings of glam rock can be traced here.
      The album was released by Mercury in April 1971 to minimal fanfare and Bowie took his first trip to the United States to promote it that spring.
      In May of the same year, Duncan Zowie Haywood Bowie was born to David and his then wife Angela.
      RCA was the next label to sign Bowie, and after a trip to America to complete the legalities, he returned to London to record two albums nearly back to back.
      Hunky Dory was built from a six-song demo that had enticed the label to sign him and features Changes and Life on Mars?. 
      Almost immediately, it was followed by the instant classic The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders from Mars—a record without which any Greatest Albums of All Time list is simply incomplete.
      1972 would be the year that Bowie ascended to international superstardom.
      GQ UK editor Dylan Jones, for example, said of the landmark 1972 Top of The Pops appearance on 6th July where Ziggy first materialized in millions of unsuspecting living rooms performing Starman, the album's lead single,  "This is the performance that turned Bowie into a star, embedding his Ziggy Stardust persona into the nation's consciousness."
      Previewed in London that spring, Bowie's extraterrestrial rockstar creation Ziggy Stardust staged one of the most spectacular and innovative live shows to date, expanding the parameters of the live rock show and singlehandedly launching a worldwide glam explosion.
